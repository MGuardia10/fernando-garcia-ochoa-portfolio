    "subtitle": "An experimental agricultural station will be developed, taking as a reference, the tradition of the colonization towns. For this purpose, “Walking between Hyphae” is proposed.",
    "p-1": "This complex will be used for research and cultivation of mushrooms. The mushroom requires very specific temperature and humidity conditions for its development phases. To do this, they will be grown underground, in a controlled environment. Specifically, the area for cultivation will be from axis 16A to 28QP.",
    "p-2": "The project idea is to make slices of different programs and place them one after the other, imitating the structure of the hyphae that make up a mushroom."
