    "subtitle": "The object of the project is to organize a party at the Z-House to celebrate the beginning of summer, the end of confinement and social restrictions.",
    "p-1": "La Bacarnal is a wild party that takes place in the renovated Church of San Pedro Apóstol in Parque Polvoranca, Leganés. It will consist of a banquet / catwalk through which your favorite corpse will be transported by some guides as in a slaughterhouse.",
    "p-2": "This exercise is the opportunity to redefine and rethink the party space from an architectural point of view. Each generation has had its ways of conceiving the party space and a way of colonizing and materializing the celebrations in the public space."
