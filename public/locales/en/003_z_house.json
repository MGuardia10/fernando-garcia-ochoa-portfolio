    "subtitle": "The purpose of the project is to give a new use to the old Pastoral Church of San Pedro Apóstol, located in the Polvoranca Park in Leganés, Madrid.",
    "p-1": "The church in question is a pre-existing piece of architecture, with great heritage value, which is currently in ruins. The purpose of the project is to respond to the current needs of its physical and social environment; and at the same time, build a respectful proposal that allows the preservation of the memory of the ruin.",
    "p-2": "The new program should be a Youth House today (with the focus on Generation Z)."
